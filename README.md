## Overview

This repo contains various tools for working with toy educational phonograph:
- [disc generator page](https://vsbogd.github.io/phonograph/disc.html) to
  generate and print the discs
- `smp2mp3.py` utility to decode/encode .smp files from the device

## Disc code

Code consists of 10 bits + 1 checksum bit. Checksum bit is set to 1 when number
of 1 in number is odd and 0 otherwise. The number of the set bits is always
even. The bits are printed counter-clockwise from the least significant one to
the last significant one. Each bit is represented by a sector which contains
both black and white parts. 0 is encoded by 6 degrees black sector which is
followed by 18 degrees white sector. 1 is encoded by 18 degrees black sector
which is followed by 6 degrees white sector. After the most significant bit
(counter-clockwise) there is a 24 degrees sector which is totally black. After
the black sector and before the least significant bit there is a big white
area.
